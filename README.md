# Hangman Game in Python
This is a simple command-line Hangman game implemented in Python. The player has to guess a random word by guessing one letter at a time. The game ends when the player either successfully guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

# Getting Started
To get started with this game, you can clone the repository or download the code as a zip file. Once you have the code on your local machine, you can run it using Python.

# Prerequisites
To run this game, you need to have Python installed on your machine.

# How to Play
To play the game, navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the file and run the following command:

`python hangman.py`

You will see a blank space for each letter in the word, along with the number of attempts remaining. You can guess one letter at a time by typing it into the command prompt and hitting enter. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct position. If the letter is not in the word, the number of attempts remaining will be decreased by one.

If you successfully guess the word before running out of attempts, you win the game! If you run out of attempts before guessing the word, you lose.

# Customization
You can customize the game by adding or removing words from the words list at the beginning of the code. You can also change the number of attempts allowed by changing the value of max_attempts.

# Acknowledgments
This game was inspired by the classic Hangman game and is a fun way to practice Python programming. Enjoy!
